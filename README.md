# The Movie Blog

## Description

The Movie Blog is a website that allows users to search for, and comment on their favorite movies!

## Usage

When you first land on the webpage, you will be greeted by a homepage with several movie cards. Clicking on any of these takes you to a page with more information on those movies as well as user comments and likes/dislikes

To leave a comment yourself, you will first need to signup then login. In the navbar located at the top of the webpage, click on the button titled login/signup and then proceed to login.

If you are new and need to signup, simply click the link under the login text boxes asking you to signup, and then fill in the information you want to use as your login credentials.

Finally, if you're interested in leaving a comment or like/dislike, after you've logged in, navigate to the movie page you wish to comment on, and click the '+ Add Comment' button. It will prompt you with a text field that you can fill out, and when you're done writing, you can click the 'post comment' button and it will generate in the comments box below.
